# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The week 1 challenge of this bootcamp was to conduct a code refactor on a provided codebase. 
The client, a marketing agency, had requested that their codebase be updated to follow accessibility standards. 
Doing this would, ideally, result in the site being optimised for search engines.

To complete this task, I updated the semantic HTML elements in the source code, ensuring that they followed a logical structure.
I updated the imagwe and icon elements with accessible <alt> attributes, and followed the scout rule of cleaning up the code and making it more presentable than when I started.

Through the course of this challenge, I learned how to edit a codebase without impacting any links to its respective CSS sheet, and the importance of accessible code to the modern web.
